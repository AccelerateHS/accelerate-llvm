-- | Objects of various sorts in LLVM IR are identified by address in the LLVM
-- C++ API, and may be given a string name. When printed to (resp. read from)
-- human-readable LLVM assembly, objects without string names are numbered
-- sequentially (resp. must be numbered sequentially). String names may be
-- quoted, and are quoted when printed if they would otherwise be misread - e.g.
-- when containing special characters.
--
-- > 7
--
-- means the seventh unnamed object, while
--
-- > "7"
--
-- means the object named with the string "7".
--
-- This libraries handling of 'UnName's during translation of the AST down into
-- C++ IR is somewhat more forgiving than the LLVM assembly parser: it does not
-- require that unnamed values be numbered sequentially; however, the numbers of
-- 'UnName's passed into C++ cannot be preserved in the C++ objects. If the C++
-- IR is printed as assembly or translated into a Haskell AST, unnamed nodes
-- will be renumbered sequentially. Thus unnamed node numbers should be thought
-- of as having any scope limited to the 'LLVM.AST.Module' in which they
-- are used.

-- TLM: 'Name' is used a lot over the place, to refer to things like variables
--      as well as basic block labels. In the first case the type makes sense,
--      but what about the latter? Should basic blocks have type '()', or 'IO
--      ()', or the type of the thing that they "return" (although, from memory
--      BBs don't really return anything, they just compute a bunch of stuff
--      which is now in scope. Hmm... the only types that we can truly know are
--      the inputs to the basic block bound via phi nodes, but this is
--      unsatisfactory... )
