-- | Convert the host array data into a memory table key.
--
-- Note: [Host arrays as memory table keys]
--
-- The raw pointer value is used as a key to the host array. This means that the
-- value is only unique as long as the array is alive, not for the entire life
-- of the program, as a StableName would be. Thus, we must be careful with its
-- use when it comes to finalisers. Consider the following situation:
--
--   1. An array is allocated on the host
--
--   2. An Accelerate computation is run. It sees that the array has no
--      corresponding device array so creates one and puts an entry in the
--      memory table.
--
--   3. Garbage collection occurs. The host side array is no longer referenced,
--      so it is deallocated. Any calls to 'deRefWeak' on the weak pointer for
--      this array will return 'Nothing'. Most importantly, the finalizer has
--      not yet run. GHC makes no guarantees about when, or even if, a finalizer
--      will run. This means there is still an entry in the memory table for
--      this array.
--
--   4. A new array is allocated host side. The allocator returns a block of
--      memory that was recently freed, the same one used for the first array.
--      This means both this new array, and the old array, have the same pointer
--      value, and thus the same 'HostArray' key.
--
--   5. Another Accelerate computation is run. It finds an entry in the memory
--      table for what it thinks is the array, but is actually the dead array.
--      It calls 'deRefWeak' on the weak pointer that has already been
--      tombstoned, and gets 'Nothing' even though the (new) key is alive,
--      because the weak pointer actually refers to the old, dead key.
--
-- Thus, if there is an existing entry in the table when we attempt to allocate
-- a new array (4), we must ensure that that entry refers to valid data.
