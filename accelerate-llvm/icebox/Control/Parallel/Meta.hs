-- | Run a parallel work-stealing operation.
--
-- Each thread initialises its work queue with an equally sized chunk of the
-- work. Threads keep working until their work search returns Nothing, at which
-- point the thread exits. In our LBS implementation, a worker thread takes a
-- small chunk of its work range to process, and places the remainder back onto
-- its deque. Thus the work queues are only empty:
--
--   (a) Briefly during the scheduling process; or
--
--   (b) After the deque has been robbed. If the stolen chunk is large enough,
--       the stealee will split the remainder onto its deque to be stolen; or
--
--   (c) There is no more work.
--
-- As long as the thread makes a small number of retries, this should correctly
-- balance the work without too much scheduler overhead.
--
-- An alternative to every thread initialising with an even chunk size is to put
-- the entire range onto the first worker and then have the scheduler handle the
-- decomposition. However, this method should be better for locality,
-- particularly when the workloads are balanced and little stealing occurs.
--
-- TLM: Should threads check whether the work queues of all threads are empty
--      before deciding to exit? If the PPT is too large then threads might not
--      react quickly enough to splitting once their deque is emptied. Maybe the
--      first thread to return Nothing can probe the queues to see if they are
--      all empty. If True, write into a shared MVar to signal to the others
--      that it is time to exit. But, that still assumes that the PPT is not so
--      large that the queues are always empty.
--
-- TLM: The initial work distribution should probably be aligned to cache
--      boundaries, rather than attempting to split exactly evenly.
