-- | This transforms the 'WorkSearch' function to add a lazy binary splitting
-- operation on top of an existing (work-stealing) scheduler. On receiving a
-- unit of work, the scheduler proceeds as follows:
--
--   1. If the number of iterations is less than the profitable parallelism
--      threshold (ppt), execute the remaining iterations and exit, else (2).
--
--   2. Check this worker's remaining work queue. If it is not empty, then
--      execute ppt iterations, then go to (1) with the remainder.
--
--   3. If the remaining work queue is empty, split this work chunk in half.
--      Place the second half onto the remaining work queue and go to (1).
