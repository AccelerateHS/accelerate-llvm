-- | The 'Gang' structure tracks the state of all workers in the program. It
-- starts empty, and workers append to it as they are brought online. Although
-- the vector append operation is expensive, it is expected it is only called
-- occasionally; e.g. at program initialisation. So, we prioritise for constant
-- lookup of the worker structure, which will be done frequently during the work
-- search.

type Gang     = MVar Workers
type Workers  = Vector Worker


-- | The 'Worker' is the per-worker-thread state.
--
-- If the worker has work that can be stolen by other processors, it is stored
-- in the 'workpool'. Thieves treat the workpool as a stack which can be popped
-- on the right, where as the owner can both push and pop on the left.
--
-- In the lazy binary splitting work stealing setup, a worker processes its
-- range in chunks, checking the state of its workpool periodically. Whenever
-- the queue is empty, it splits it's current workload in two so that the second
-- half can be stolen by another processor.

-- A global name supply. This is not strictly necessary, but useful for ensuring
-- that each worker thread has a unique identifier. We can't just use the

--
-- TLM: This isn't a bottleneck, but it would have been better to use something
-- like 'Data.Atomic' as in the base Accelerate package.

-- | The finaliser for worker threads.
--
-- Without this programs can complain about "Blocked indefinitely on an MVar"

--
-- We're relying on the comment in System.Mem.Weak that says:
--
--     "If there are no other threads to run, the runtime system will check for
--      runnable finalizers before declaring the system to be deadlocked."
--
-- If we were creating and destroying the gang cleanly we wouldn't need this,
