-- Top-level mutable state
-- -----------------------
--
-- It is important to keep some information alive for the entire run of the
-- program, not just a single execution. These tokens use 'unsafePerformIO' to
-- ensure they are executed only once, and reused for subsequent invocations.
--

-- | Initialise the gang of threads that will be used to execute computations.
-- This spawns one worker on each capability, which can be set via +RTS -Nn.
--
-- This globally shared thread gang is auto-initialised on startup and shared by
-- all computations (unless the user chooses to 'run' with a different gang).
--
-- In a data parallel setting, it does not help to have multiple gangs running
-- at the same time. This is because a single data parallel computation should
-- already be able to keep all threads busy. If we had multiple gangs running at
-- the same time, then the system as a whole would run slower as the gangs
-- contend for cache and thrash the scheduler.
