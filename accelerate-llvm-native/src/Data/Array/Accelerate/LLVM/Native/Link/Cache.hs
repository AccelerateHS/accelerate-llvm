  -- For whatever reason ghci isn't adding library dependencies to the
  -- dynamic link state, which means that dynamic linking will fail in
  -- tracy mode because we depend on tracy symbols exported by the
  -- accelerate library. This brings those symbols into scope so that they
  -- can be found by later calls to dlsym().
  --
  -- Additionally, the Accelerate library has been compiled with -rdynamic
  -- in order to bring all exported symbols into the global symbol table.
  -- This seems to be required so that dlsym() can find symbols from the
  -- GHC RTS when we are in compiled (not interpreted) mode. In non-ghci
  -- mode, loading the RTS dynamic library explicitly (as we do with the
  -- Accelerate library) causes segfaults; possibly because the RTS was
  -- otherwise linked statically into the executable.
  --
  -- Because the accelerate library lives somewhere in ~/.cabal/..., this
  -- hack prevents executables from running on any other machine than the
  -- one they were built on. Fortunately, this happens only in tracy mode.
