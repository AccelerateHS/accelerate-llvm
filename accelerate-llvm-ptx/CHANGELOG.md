# Change Log

Notable changes to the project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/) and the
project adheres to the [Haskell Package Versioning
Policy (PVP)](https://pvp.haskell.org)

## [1.2.0.0] - 2018-04-03
### Changed
 * `run` variants which do not take an explicit execution context now execute on
   the first available device in an exclusive fashion. Multi-GPU systems can
   specify the default set of GPUs to use with environment variable
   `ACCELERATE_LLVM_PTX_DEVICES` as a list of device ordinals.

### Added
 * support for half-precision floats
 * support for struct-of-array-of-struct representations
 * support 64-bit atomic-add instruction in forward permutations ([#363])
 * support for LLVM-6.0
 * support for GHC-8.4
