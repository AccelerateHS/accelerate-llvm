This package compiles Accelerate code to LLVM IR, and executes that code on
multicore CPUs as well as NVIDIA GPUs. This avoids the need to go through `nvcc`
or `clang`. For details on Accelerate, refer to the [main repository][GitHub].

We love all kinds of contributions, so feel free to open issues for missing
features as well as report (or fix!) bugs on the [issue tracker][Issues].

Dependencies
------------

Haskell dependencies are available from Hackage, but there are several external
library dependencies that you will need to install as well:

 * [`LLVM`](http://llvm.org)
 * [`libFFI`](http://sourceware.org/libffi/) (if using the `accelerate-llvm-native` backend for multicore CPUs)
 * [`CUDA`](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads) (if using the `accelerate-llvm-ptx` backend for NVIDIA GPUs)


Docker
------

A [docker](https://www.docker.com) container is provided with this package
preinstalled (via stack) at `/opt/accelerate-llvm`. Note that if you wish to use
the `accelerate-llvm-ptx` GPU backend, you will need to install the [NVIDIA
docker](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker) plugin; see that page for more
information.

```sh
$ docker run -it tmcdonell/accelerate-llvm
```


Installing LLVM
---------------

When installing LLVM, make sure that it includes the `libLLVM` shared library.
If you want to use the GPU targeting `accelerate-llvm-ptx` backend, make sure
you install (or build) LLVM with the 'nvptx' target.

## Homebrew

Example using [Homebrew](http://brew.sh) on macOS:

```sh
$ brew install llvm-hs/homebrew-llvm/llvm-6.0
```

## Debian/Ubuntu

For Debian/Ubuntu based Linux distributions, the LLVM.org website provides
binary distribution packages. Check [apt.llvm.org](http://apt.llvm.org) for
instructions for adding the correct package database for your OS version, and
then:

```sh
$ apt-get install llvm-6.0-dev
```

## Building from source

If your OS does not have an appropriate LLVM distribution available, you can also build from source. Detailed build instructions are available on the [LLVM.org website](http://releases.llvm.org/6.0.0/docs/CMake.html). Note that you will require at least [CMake 3.4.3](http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html) and a recent C++ compiler; at least Clang 3.1, GCC 4.8, or Visual Studio 2015 (update 3).

  1. Download and unpack the [LLVM-6.0 source code](http://releases.llvm.org/6.0.0/llvm-6.0.0.src.tar.xz). We'll refer to
     the path that the source tree was unpacked to as `LLVM_SRC`. Only the main
     LLVM source tree is required, but you can optionally add other components
     such as the Clang compiler or Polly loop optimiser. See the [LLVM releases](http://releases.llvm.org/download.html#6.0.0)
     page for the complete list.

  2. Create a temporary build directory and `cd` into it, for example:
     ```sh
     $ mkdir /tmp/build
     $ cd /tmp/build
     ```

  3. Execute the following to configure the build. Here `INSTALL_PREFIX` is
     where LLVM is to be installed, for example `/usr/local` or
     `$HOME/opt/llvm`:
     ```sh
     $ cmake $LLVM_SRC -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$INSTALL_PREFIX -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DLLVM_ENABLE_ASSERTIONS=ON -DLLVM_BUILD_LLVM_DYLIB=ON -DLLVM_LINK_LLVM_DYLIB=ON
     ```
     See [options and variables](http://llvm.org/docs/CMake.html#options-and-variables)
     for a list of additional build parameters you can specify.

  4. Build and install:
     ```sh
     $ cmake --build .
     $ cmake --build . --target install
     ```

  5. For macOS only, some additional steps are useful to work around issues related
     to [System Integrity Protection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_Integrity_Protection):
     ```sh
     cd $INSTALL_PREFIX/lib
     ln -s libLLVM.dylib libLLVM-6.0.dylib
     install_name_tool -id $PWD/libLTO.dylib libLTO.dylib
     install_name_tool -id $PWD/libLLVM.dylib libLLVM.dylib
     install_name_tool -change '@rpath/libLLVM.dylib' $PWD/libLLVM.dylib libLTO.dylib
     ```


Installing Accelerate-LLVM
--------------------------

Once the dependencies are installed, we are ready to install `accelerate-llvm`.

For example, installation using [`stack`](http://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README.html)
just requires you to point it to the appropriate configuration file:
```sh
$ ln -s stack-8.2.yaml stack.yaml
$ stack setup
$ stack install
```

Note that the version of [`llvm-hs`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/llvm-hs)
used must match the installed version of LLVM, which is currently 6.0.


## libNVVM

The `accelerate-llvm-ptx` backend can optionally be compiled to generate GPU
code using the `libNVVM` library, rather than LLVM's inbuilt NVPTX code
generator. `libNVVM` is a closed-source library distributed as part of the
NVIDIA CUDA toolkit, and is what the `nvcc` compiler itself uses internally when
compiling CUDA C code.

Using `libNVVM` _may_ improve GPU performance compared to the code generator
built in to LLVM. One difficulty with using it however is that since `libNVVM`
is also based on LLVM, and typically lags LLVM by several releases, you must
install `accelerate-llvm` with a "compatible" version of LLVM, which will depend
on the version of the CUDA toolkit you have installed. The following table shows
some combinations:

|              | LLVM-3.3 | LLVM-3.4 | LLVM-3.5 | LLVM-3.8 | LLVM-3.9 | LLVM-4.0 | LLVM-5.0 |
|:------------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|
| **CUDA-7.0** |     ⭕    |     ❌    |          |          |          |          |          |
| **CUDA-7.5** |          |     ⭕    |     ⭕    |     ❌    |          |          |          |
| **CUDA-8.0** |          |          |     ⭕    |     ⭕    |     ❌    |     ❌    |          |
| **CUDA-9.0** |          |          |          |          |          |     ❌    |     ❌    |

Where ⭕ = Works, and ❌ = Does not work.

Note that the above restrictions on CUDA and LLVM version exist _only_ if you
want to use the NVVM component. Otherwise, you should be free to use any
combination of CUDA and LLVM.

Also note that `accelerate-llvm-ptx` itself currently requires at least LLVM-3.5.

Using `stack`, either edit the `stack.yaml` and add the following section:

```yaml
flags:
  accelerate-llvm-ptx:
    nvvm: true
```

Or install using the following option on the command line:

```sh
$ stack install accelerate-llvm-ptx --flag accelerate-llvm-ptx:nvvm
```

If installing via `cabal`:

```sh
$ cabal install accelerate-llvm-ptx -fnvvm
```
