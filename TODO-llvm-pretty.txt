These are the things that are either needed by the Native backend, or are
needed by the PTX backend and already discovered by just porting the
LLVM.AST.Type hierarchy, and are not supported by llvm-pretty.

- Parameter attributes: NoAlias, NoCapture.
  -> We should benchmark before/after here to see if they are required.

- Function call attributes: NoUnwind, NoDuplicate.
  -> The original llvm-hs code put these attributes both on the function
     _declaration_ and on the _call_ to that function. llvm-pretty doesn't
     support function call attributes at all, but the LLVM documentation isn't
     clear on whether putting an attribute on a call is necessary if it's
     already there on the declaration.

- Volatile stores and loads: only used in PTX backend

- Inline assembly: only used in PTX backend

- Half floats: could be use on CPU, but only really useful on GPU

- Function attributes: Convergent, InaccessibleMemOnly. Only used in PTX
  backend
